IV  [IVTF] Temporary Files
-------------------------------------------
There are some temporary files that are
created with this program and those files
are stored within this same directory. The
files start with the three letters 'cur'
and only hold some data and can safely be
deleted without problems as they will be
re-downloaded without error for when the
application refreshes itself every 60
seconds. Also, on the off-beat there is
an interent problem when downloading one
or all of the files, there wil be a file
created called 'err.log' with information
about the date and time the error occured
along with an error number that corresponds
to the image that failed. For the error
numbers see the chart below:

ERROR NUMBER	IMAGE FAILED?
